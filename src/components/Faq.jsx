          <FAQItem question="How does wallet generation work?">
            This code generates wallets by creating a random signing private key, deriving its corresponding public key, checking if the public key matches a given prefix, and then combining the private and public keys to form a full private key, which is then encoded and returned.
          </FAQItem>
          
          <FAQItem question="How do I know my private keys are safe?">
            Your private keys are never exposed to the outside world during the generation process, as they are kept within the local environment and encoded securely using Base58 before being returned.
          </FAQItem>
          
          <FAQItem question="Can I use the private key from this custom generator to interact with the Solana blockchain?">
            Yes, once generated, the private key can be used to sign transactions and interact with the Solana blockchain, while the public key is used as the wallet address.
          </FAQItem>
          
          <FAQItem question="Why is my desired prefix or suffix not generating after a long period of time?">
            Generating a wallet with a specific prefix or suffix requires finding a random key pair that matches the condition, which can take a significant amount of time due to the randomness of key generation and the vast number of possible combinations.
          </FAQItem>
          
          <FAQItem question="What trading platforms can I use this wallet with?">
            You can use generated wallets on platforms that support import. Such as Axiom, Bullx, or popular telegram trading bots.
          </FAQItem>
          
          <FAQItem question="What happens if I donâ€™t like the generated wallet address?">
            You can simply generate a new wallet address with different prefixes or suffixes until you find one you prefer.
